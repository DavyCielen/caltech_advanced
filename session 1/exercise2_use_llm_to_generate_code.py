# Prompt an LLM with the request: "Write a Python function that returns only the even numbers from a given list."
# Copy the generated code into your editor and test it with various inputs.
# If you encounter any issues, share the error message with the LLM and observe how it refines its solution.
# so the signature of the function is like this:
# def even_numbers(lst):
#     pass
# example 1 for an input [1,3,6,7] the output should be [6]
# example 2 for an input [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] the output should be [2,4,6,8]
# example 3 for an input [1,3,5,7] the output should be []
